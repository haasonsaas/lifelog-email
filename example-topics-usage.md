# Topics Extractor Example Usage

This document demonstrates how to use the topics extractor with sample conversation scenarios.

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { extractTopics, formatTopicsAsHtml, formatTopicsAsText } from './src/extractors/core/topics';
import type { Lifelog, Env } from './src/types';

// Sample lifelog with conversation data
const sampleLifelogs: Lifelog[] = [
  {
    id: "team-meeting-1",
    title: "Weekly Team Meeting",
    startTime: "2024-03-20T09:00:00Z",
    endTime: "2024-03-20T10:30:00Z",
    markdown: "",
    contents: [
      // ... conversation content
    ]
  }
];

// Environment configuration
const env: Env = {
  OPENAI_API_KEY: "your-openai-api-key",
  TIMEZONE: "America/Los_Angeles",
  // ... other env vars
};

// Extract topics
const result = await extractTopics(sampleLifelogs, env);

// Format for email
const htmlOutput = formatTopicsAsHtml(result);
const textOutput = formatTopicsAsText(result);
```

## Integration with Email System

The topics extractor integrates seamlessly with the existing email digest system:

```typescript
// In extractors.ts
export async function conversation_topics(lifelogs: Lifelog[], env: Env): Promise<{ html: string; text: string }> {
  const result = await extractTopics(lifelogs, env);
  
  return {
    html: formatTopicsAsHtml(result),
    text: formatTopicsAsText(result)
  };
}
```

This provides both HTML and plain text versions for email compatibility, following the same pattern as other extractors in the system.
